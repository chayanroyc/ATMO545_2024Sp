# ATMO/HWRS 545: Introduction to Data Assimilation 
<img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/chayanroyc/ATMO545_2024Sp/assets/49596459/ed540685-274d-4cba-9174-dd9966c8f0ca">

## Course Description
Data assimilation (DA) involves combining
information from observations and
“models” of a particular physical system in
order to best define and understand the
evolving state of the system. It is currently
applied across a wide range of Earth
sciences, including weather forecasting,
oceanography, atmospheric chemistry,
hydrology, and climate studies. This course
provides an introduction to the theory and
applications of DA in atmospheric and
related sciences. Topics include common
DA methods like optimal interpolation,
Kalman filtering and variational schemes
within the context of estimation theory. The
course is designed as a hands-on
approach to key DA concepts that are
currently used today

### Goals & Objectives

My intent as an instructor is to convey applied
concepts of data assimilation such that
students will:
* gain an understanding of basic principles
of current DA algorithms
* think holistically of data and models in the
context of associated errors
* grasp the significance of current DA
algorithms in analysis and forecasting
research and operations
* know how to use DA techniques to real
world applications (your own research).
