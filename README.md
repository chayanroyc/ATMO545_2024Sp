# ATMO/HWRS 545: Introduction to Data Assimilation 
<img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/chayanroyc/ATMO545_2024Sp/assets/49596459/ed540685-274d-4cba-9174-dd9966c8f0ca">

## Course Description
Data assimilation (DA) involves combining
information from observations and
“models” of a particular physical system in
order to best define and understand the
evolving state of the system. It is currently
applied across a wide range of Earth
sciences, including weather forecasting,
oceanography, atmospheric chemistry,
hydrology, and climate studies. This course
provides an introduction to the theory and
applications of DA in atmospheric and
related sciences. Topics include common
DA methods like optimal interpolation,
Kalman filtering and variational schemes
within the context of estimation theory. The
course is designed as a hands-on
approach to key DA concepts that are
currently used today

### Goals & Objectives

My intent as an instructor is to convey applied
concepts of data assimilation such that
students will:
* gain an understanding of basic principles
of current DA algorithms
* think holistically of data and models in the
context of associated errors
* grasp the significance of current DA
algorithms in analysis and forecasting
research and operations
* know how to use DA techniques to real
world applications (your own research).

## GitHub

This Git repository hosts Python versions of the class exercises and homework as the original solutions are in Matlab.

## Instructions on running the Jupyter notebooks in Google Colab

* Go to https://colab.research.google.com/ (Gmail sign-in required)
* You should see a screen like this, if not, go to File -> Open notebook

* Click on the search button to find the notebooks from the repository.
* Click on the notebook you need to interact with.
* Once the notebook opens, wait for a few seconds for the kernel to connect. Then go to **Runtime** in the menu bar and click *Run all*
* At the end of the notebook, the interactive widget should appear.
